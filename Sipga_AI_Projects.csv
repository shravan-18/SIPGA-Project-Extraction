9,Sparse modelling to identify biomarkers related to breast cancer therapeutic response from multi-omics data,"Breast cancer (BC) is a highly heterogeneous tumor type that shows different clinical behavior and responses to same treatment. Clinical management of BC patients remains challenging due to underlying tumor subtypes (eg, LumA, LumB, Her2, Basal) with lack of specific early-stage clinical biomarkers [1]. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop robust strategies to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment for early diagnosis of BC. Recent advances in multi-omics (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) sequencing platforms provide opportunities to study breast cancer at different molecular levels to discover novel biomarkers and identify new therapeutic targets [2, 3]. Several studies have developed machine learning methods to stratify breast cancer subtypes at single-omics level using common risk predictors [4-6]. However, single omics analyses are limited to correlations and primarily reflect reactive processes rather than causal one. Integrating different omics data may provide more biological insights, for example, further improved prediction of the breast cancer subtypes. Many data-driven approaches to multi-omics analysis are aimed at patient stratification, biomarker discovery, pathway analysis and drug discovery [2]. However, multi-omics data are high-dimensional and very noisy, and most existing studies rarely incorporate knowledge of biological pathways or structural relationships between genes into modelling algorithms. Genes act together in signalling, regulatory pathway, and protein complexes. In addition, robust and interpretable strategies are highly demanded, can help to explore hidden biological patterns which may lead to new biological hypotheses. The objective of this study is to develop a robust multi-omics data analysis method incorporating knowledge of biological pathways/structural relationships between genes to discover disease-specific new trans-omics biomarkers, disease classification, drug repurposing and drug discovery.

Objectives with specific aims and possible outcome.  The main objectives of this research project are as follows:
1. Develop new computational methods for integrating multi-omics datasets in a data-driven and biologically structured manner.
2. Identify novel disease-specific trans-omics associations that map to differentially enriched pathways, subnetworks, and new connections.
3. Develop free software to discover disease-specific trans-omics connections that can be widely applied to any disease analysis. 

Expected outcome:  Our proposed method enables interpretable analysis of multi-omics data and is expected to be published in high-impact journals such as Nature communication, Bioinformatics, and Nucleic Acid Res. etc.

41,Physics-Informed ML for Modelling our World,"Many complex phenomena in nature of relevance to science and engineering (e.g. animal skin patterns / urban wind flow) are governed by dynamical systems and seemingly simple differential equations. While useful, identifying the exact parameters that describe these systems from limited data is very difficult, even as simulating these models themselves can be very computationally expensive. Hence, we seek to investigate the effectiveness of physics-informed ML methods as a potentially less computationally expensive and more accurate route to modelling such systems in both a forward meta-modelling setting and an inverse inference setting.","1.

43,AI-driven olfactory mapping of environmental pollutants ,"
The accurate detection and quantification of odors in the environment are essential for effective pollution control. While a general olfactory map has been developed recently, it is primarily designed for the fragrance industry and does not address the specific needs related to environmental pollutants. Currently, there is a significant gap in the availability of a dedicated olfactory map tailored to identify and trace the sources of these pollutants. In this project, the successful candidate will: 1. Compile a dataset encompassing prevalent environmental pollutants in the region, drawing from reputable scientific literature. 2.  Evaluate the accuracy of state-of-the-art machine learning models specific to common environmental pollutants. 3. Fine-tuned these models with transfer learning  to exclusively target environmental pollutants,  and assess their accuracies. This research endeavor will contribute valuable insights towards the development of a specialized olfactory mapping system for environmental pollutants.","At the end of the project, student will be able to perform routine cheminformatics analysis and machine learning for molecules",1.
