Transcriptomics Analysis of Lifespan Regulating Drug Response,"High-throughput gene expression sequencing and analyses have dominated much of biological research in the last decade. The major challenge here is to tackle the large dataset into a manageable way for novel and key biological inference.

Sparse modelling to identify biomarkers related to breast cancer therapeutic response from multi-omics data,"Breast cancer (BC) is a highly heterogeneous tumor type that shows different clinical behavior and responses to same treatment. Clinical management of BC patients remains challenging due to underlying tumor subtypes (eg, LumA, LumB, Her2, Basal) with lack of specific early-stage clinical biomarkers [1]. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop robust strategies to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment for early diagnosis of BC. Recent advances in multi-omics (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) sequencing platforms provide opportunities to study breast cancer at different molecular levels to discover novel biomarkers and identify new therapeutic targets [2, 3]. Several studies have developed machine learning methods to stratify breast cancer subtypes at single-omics level using common risk predictors [4-6]. However, single omics analyses are limited to correlations and primarily reflect reactive processes rather than causal one. Integrating different omics data may provide more biological insights, for example, further improved prediction of the breast cancer subtypes. Many data-driven approaches to multi-omics analysis are aimed at patient stratification, biomarker discovery, pathway analysis and drug discovery [2]. However, multi-omics data are high-dimensional and very noisy, and most existing studies rarely incorporate knowledge of biological pathways or structural relationships between genes into modelling algorithms. Genes act together in signalling, regulatory pathway, and protein complexes. In addition, robust and interpretable strategies are highly demanded, can help to explore hidden biological patterns which may lead to new biological hypotheses. The objective of this study is to develop a robust multi-omics data analysis method incorporating knowledge of biological pathways/structural relationships between genes to discover disease-specific new trans-omics biomarkers, disease classification, drug repurposing and drug discovery.

Objectives with specific aims and possible outcome.  The main objectives of this research project are as follows:
1. Develop new computational methods for integrating multi-omics datasets in a data-driven and biologically structured manner.
2. Identify novel disease-specific trans-omics associations that map to differentially enriched pathways, subnetworks, and new connections.
3. Develop free software to discover disease-specific trans-omics connections that can be widely applied to any disease analysis. 

Expected outcome:  Our proposed method enables interpretable analysis of multi-omics data and is expected to be published in high-impact journals such as Nature communication, Bioinformatics, and Nucleic Acid Res. etc.

Methods and Materials:  Datasets: TCGA BRCA dataset, https://github.com/GaoLabXDU/MultiOmicsIntegrationStudy/PPI Network Data: We downloaded human PPI from StringDB (v11.5) as the graph structure input, which consisted of 19,385 vertices and 11,938,498 edges. Data QC and Visualization: PCA, Clustering, Lasso, etc. Integrative approaches: CCA (Canonical Correlation Analysis), Multi-task CCA, etc. [7].

Genome wide in-vivo functional genetic screen to identify novel modulators of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD),"With a global prevalence of 25.2%, NAFLD is the leading cause of chronic liver disease. Regarded as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, NAFLD is tightly linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes. It includes a variety of histopathological findings ranging from simple steatosis to steatosis coupled with inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) to cirrhosis. It is projected to soon become the number one reason for liver transplantations. Despite this, NAFLD continues to be an underdiagnosed disease with no current approved treatment. This is primarily due to lack of understanding of the mechanisms underlying NAFLD development and progression. To address this, we performed a genome-wide in-vivo functional genetic screen in a relevant mouse model for NAFLD to identify novel regulators for the development of new therapeutic approaches.

Overcome TME-induced T cell exhaustion to augment anti-breast cancer immunity,"Tumor microenvironment (TME) is hostile to infiltrating T cells. Infiltrated T cells in the tumor microenvironment will undergo functional disability, loss of stemness and terminal exhaustion. In the breast cancer subtype, tumor hypoxia, persistent antigen activation and other features of tumor microenvironment causes dysfunction and exhaustion of infiltrating T cells, which is the leading reason for failure of immunotherapies in breast cancer treatment. We developed an in vitro co-culture system to model breast cancer microenvironment, which quickly drives T cells to terminal exhaustion. We identified a few gene targets that regulate T cell differentiation and exhaustion. Genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of these targets reduced T cell exhaustion and boosted tumor responses to immunotherapies.

Advancing Quantum Control through Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Quantum computers offer exponential processing speed compared to classical counterparts, with wide-reaching potential applications. Nevertheless, their susceptibility to errors poses a significant challenge. Research shows that skilful low-level control design can mitigate hardware-induced errors. However, conventional quantum control relies heavily on precise physical models, introducing model bias, particularly in noisy intermediate-scale quantum systems. To overcome these limitations, we utilize deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for robust quantum control, free from the constraints of a specific Hamiltonian model. We enhance our DRL models with meticulously designed agents, refined rewards, and effective exploration-exploitation strategies. Employing a two-stage DRL agent training method reduces time and improves accuracy. In addition, our adoption of online learning empowers the DRL agent to adapt continually to dynamic noise sources. The aim of our DRL-based quantum control method is to achieve higher target state fidelity in less time while displaying increased resilience to noise.

Development of Simulation Tool to Characterize Light Propagation in Sea Water for Optical Wireless Communication,"Recent developments in optical wireless communication (OWC) have revealed the potential and advantages of optical waves over radiofrequency (RF) and acoustic waves, especially in scenarios involving high-speed, medium-range communication from water to air. Optical waves, specifically in the blue-green window (ranging from 450 nm to 550 nm), exhibit acceptable propagation attenuation in both water and air mediums. Moreover, approximately 90% of optical wave energy can penetrate the water surface when the incident angle is small to medium. OWC facilitates high-speed data transmission through laser or light-emitting diode (LED) technology, offering a compact and cost-effective integration. These appealing attributes render OWC a promising solution for optical wireless communication. To model the trajectory and energy loss of photons emitted from a light source in this context, the Monte Carlo method is frequently employed. In this project, we will develop a modified Monte Carlo tool for simulating the anisotropic transport of visible light in turbid seawater, encompassing air-sea and seafloor boundaries. One of the major challenges in implementing this simulation tool is the consideration of wave action at the sea surface. Different frequency, energy, and direction components of waves introduce random fluctuations to the air-water interface. To provide a more realistic representation of the distribution of wave slopes and amplitudes in the simulation, we aim to incorporate a wave spectrum function that describes the distribution of wave slopes at any given point and time, using a 2D Gram Charlier distribution in conjunction with a Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum.","Optical Wireless Communication, Channel Modeling, Monte Carlo Simulation, Scattering, Absorption, Wave action ",Conduct the research honestly and uphold the integrity; keep the working place (IHPC) safe ,"Students would possess strong background in Math (and Physics), having the interest in coding using MATLAB/Python","1. literature review

Chemical Free and Energy Efficient Processes for Wastewater Treatment and Water Circularity,"Wastewaters need be properly treated to mitigate pollution to environment and reclaim water sources for reuse. The contaminants in wastewaters may present in various types (soluble, non-soluble, inorganic, organic, microbial, etc.) and at different concentrations (from < 1 mg/L to > 100 g/L). Therefore, a comprehensive process including different technologies (biological, chemical, physical) would be a practical solution to remove these contaminants in the wastewaters. However, there are several limitations in current wastewater treatment technologies. For example, coagulation has sludge disposal problems, biological treatment (both aerobic and anaerobic processes) requires substantial chemical input for pretreatment and conditioning, as well as post-treatment of the sludge. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) could provide non-selective oxidation to degrade organic contaminants which are not suitable for biological treatment, but the high cost and potential toxic by-products need be adressed. In this project, we will leverage on the synergistic effect of hybrid wastewater treatment technologies to provide minimal chemical addition, sludge generation and secondary pollution in wastewater treatment, and to achieve water circularity in sustainable manufacturing.","The student will learn analytical tools for water and wastewater characterization, electrochemical advanced oxidation process for organic wastewater treatment, filtration process, as well as other research skills including literature review and data analysis.",The attached student will go through HSE induction and briefing and ensure safety compliance.

Collaborative Logistics Planning and Optimization,"Logistics plays a big role to ensure delivery to customers promptly and efficiently. Logistics operators in supply chains may have their own inventory / route optimization engines that operate in silos that produce sub-optimal decisions, causing delays, increased cost and reduced service levels that could have been avoided if proper coordination/consolidation had been sought. Effective logistics planning is needed to enable collaboration and coordination among logistics service providers to provide quality fulfilment services while ensuring cost and carbon efficiency and challenging operational constraints in inventory, routing, packing, and loading/unloading. The underlying logistics planning algorithms in existing solutions always consider the logistics planning as an optimisation problem and describe it in the form of mathematical programming, which is hard to capture the dynamics and collaboration among players. Furthermore, existing logistics planning solutions always ignore some realistic yet crucial factors such as loading sequence and inventory status.  They affect not only the collaboration among the players, but also the eventual logistics cost. Due to the computational hardness, a multi-party logistic planning solution taking into account all above factors is desired yet out of reach so far. In this proposal, we will explore to tackle the dynamics (e.g. the demands, inventory, and fulfilment status), and the coordination among logistics players and other players, a learning-to-optimise planning algorithm will be developed. To capture the features of different roles (e.g. customers, fulfilment centers or depots, and fleets), specifically designed deep neural networks will be developed to facilitate the decision making. To handle the constraints (e.g. loading sequence) while reducing logistics cost, techniques related to constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP) (e.g. reward shaping and trust region policy optimisation) will be developed. The deliverable will be a multi-party multi-depot logistics planning platform solution which enables coordinated logistics planning with consideration of loading sequence and inventory status.","The project objective is to develop AI-based learning-to-optimise algorithm for collaborative logistics planning to tackle the dynamics (e.g. the demands, inventory, and fulfilment status), and the coordination among logistics players and other players","(1).

Lamina associated heterochromatin changes in fibrosis,"The nuclear periphery is a critical compartment in genome organization and transcriptional regulation. It provides structural constraints and repressive capabilities, playing a fundamental role in these processes. During development, genes not required for a specific cell type are relocated to the nuclear periphery, where they remain silent as heterochromatin. Additionally, proteins at the nuclear periphery mechanically link the nucleus to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, subjecting chromatin in this region (termed LADs for Lamina Associated Domains) to mechanical perturbations. This makes chromatin in the nuclear periphery highly susceptible to misregulation, particularly in diseases like fibrosis. While techniques for mapping LADs in cell culture have been developed, mapping them in tissues is less optimized.

Due to the limited access of samples from human brain, we established in vitro induced neuronal culture system in the lab and now working on the setup of other types of cell culture. We aim to do the systematic analysis of metabolomics from normal neurons/glia and also compare them with the disease-causing mutations bearing counterparts, which could be generated using CRISPR/Cas9 system. We will also study candidate molecules in the in vitro culture system, once confirmed and we plan to verify the effects in mice.","The student will be trained in the field of molecular biology and neuroscience and learn basic skill in: 1, general molecular cloning work; 2, basic cell culture and human ES cell culture; 3, differentiation of human ES cells to neurons; 4, basic biochemical work including protein samples preparaton and detection, immunostaining and analysis.

On-demand bonding and debonding polymer adhesives from renewable resources,"This student project is working towards the development of on-demand bonding and debonding polymer adhesives. Conventional adhesives often contain toxic monomers and are difficult to be removed after use. There is thus an urgent demand for non-harmful and renewable adhesives of which the bonding and debonding processes can be facilely controlled by external moduli. This work aims to use light as a trigger to achieve photoresponsive adhesives material, taking advantage of the precise spatial and temporal control that light offers. The adhesives will be further prepared using natural polymers as the main reagents, offering a smart and sustainable material platform. Working with a team of researchers, this student shall contribute towards a chemical platform for advancing the field of sustainable and responsive materials, with properties including on-demand bonding and debonding.","Students will learn basic synthetic chemistry techniques such as organic synthesis, polymer and materials synthesis. He/she will learn how to design, perform and monitor chemistry experiments, and subsequently purification and data characterization experiments may be performed.
